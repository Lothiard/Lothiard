Hi,
I'm an 18 years old high school student from Hungary, and I've been interested in coding ever since i was about 9.
In the beginning I was mostly interested in gamedev because that made programming playful enough for it to be fun, so i spent most of my time trying to copy youtube tutorials and learn from them.
My current goal is to solve all the hungarian matura exam's IT part which used to be named "informatika", but now it's "digitális kultúra" for some reason.

All of the exams can be found in https://www.oktatas.hu/kozneveles/erettsegi/feladatsorok under emelt szint -> digitalis kultura or informatika, and my solutions in a repo.

note that i am completely self-taught because high school didn't really teach anything at all, and the only language i know is C++.
