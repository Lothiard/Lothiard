Hi,
I'm an 18 years old high school student from Hungary, and I've been interested in coding ever since i was about 9.
In the beginning I was mostly interested in gamedev because that made programming playful enough for it to be fun, so i spent most of my time trying to copy youtube turorials and learn from them.
My current goal is to solve all the hungarian matura exam's IT part, which is called "digitális kultúra" for some reason.

All of the exams can be found in https://www.oktatas.hu/kozneveles/erettsegi/feladatsorok under emelt szint -> digitalis kultura, and my solutions in my repo under the same name.

note that i am completely self-taught because high school didn't really teach anything at all, and the only langugage i know is C++.
