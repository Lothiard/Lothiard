## ðŸŒ± Projects

### [elte-cs-bsc](https://github.com/Lothiard/elte-cs-bsc)
Everything I do at the university I just commit here because I like having everything version controlled, also someone might find it interesting.

### [digitalis-kultura](https://github.com/Lothiard/digitalis-kultura)
As practice for the Hungarian Matura exams, I solved most of the previous years' IT exam's programming parts. This project will forever hold a special place in my heart because it is purely written in C++ that I learned by myself intuitively. Also it helped me get into ELTE.
