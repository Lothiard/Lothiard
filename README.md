## 'Experience'
### from uni
- Proficient in writing suboptimal algorithms with [enforced obvious bad practices](https://github.com/Lothiard/elte-cs-bsc/tree/main/1/.prog) that make me scream in pain
- Able to efficiently turn UML diagrams into boilerplate code 
- Learned to write super fast LaTeX and Typst to keep up with the unholy amount of math I am forced to endure

### from self-study
- Gamedev in Unreal Engine 5 and Godot
- Bash scripting and some Lua to rice Linux and nvim (by the way I use neovim btw)
- C++ by reading lots of books and succumbing to the evil corporate world by solving [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/u/Lothiard/) every day

I only really like C++ and Python; the rest I (am forced to) tolerate  
I also won national first place back in 2016 in a [gamedev competition by Microsoft](https://www.pcwplus.hu/szoftver/veget-ert-elso-kodu-kupa-221476.html) which is pretty cool

## 'Education'

- **Degree:** BSc in Computer Science
- **University:** Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE)
- **Current Year:** Second Year
