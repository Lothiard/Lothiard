- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Lothiard
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning how to code, primarily c++. I've been interested in making games since I was a kid and I finally got to the point where I actually committed.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning c++ in school, that's why I want to focus on that language instead of learning something easier at first.
- ğŸ“« If you want to reach me: my discord is Lothiard59#4851, I'm on here most of the time.
