## ðŸŒ± Projects

### [elte-cs-bsc](https://github.com/Lothiard/elte-cs-bsc)
Everything I do at the university can be found here because I like having it version-controlled, also someone might find it interesting.

### [digitalis-kultura](https://github.com/Lothiard/digitalis-kultura)
As practice for the Hungarian Matura exams, I solved most programming parts of the previous year's IT exam. This project will forever hold a special place in my heart because it is purely written in C++, which I learned intuitively. It also helped me get into ELTE.
