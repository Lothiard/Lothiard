### [digitalis-kultura](https://github.com/Lothiard/digitalis-kultura)
As practice for the Hungarian Matura exam, I solved every IT exam's programming part between 2012 and 2024. This project will forever hold a special place in my heart because it is purely written in C++, which I learned intuitively. It also helped me get into ELTE.
